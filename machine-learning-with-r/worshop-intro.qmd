## Quarto

 - Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished presentation. To learn more about Quarto presentations see <https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/>.
 - This slideshow was created using Quatro presentation file format from RStudio with R version: `r R.Version()` 

## Packages {.bigger}

```{r, error=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidymodels)
library(skimr)
```

## Workshop Contents

 1. Introduction to `{tidymodels}`
 2. Single split data; logistic regression
 3. Same data, multiple folds, tuning hyperparamters, Random Forest
 4. Exercise, different data -> DIY
 5. Case demo -> DIY

## Data

 - Dataset with mutagens and non-mutagens
 - Obtained from https://github.com/simonpcouch/mutagen
 - Glimpse at the data

```{r}
load(
 here::here(
   "data-raw",
   "mutagen_tbl.Rda"
 )
)
```
 
## Mutagen data 

Let's look at the first 5 variables

```{r}
mutagen_tbl[ , c(1:5)] |>
  glimpse()
```

## Tidymodels workflow

 1. Exploratory Data Analysis 
 1. `Split` data into training and test datasets
 1. Create a model `specification` (model type and hyperparameter settings)
 1. Create a `recipe` with model `formula` and pre-processing `steps`
 1. Create `workflow` holding the `specification` and the `recipe`
 1. `tune` the model for hyperparameter values
 1. `fit` the model on the training dataset
 1. `fit` the model on the test dataset
 1. Evaluate the model, using performance metrics

## Two modelling runs on the same data

 1. Single splits, no tuning
 2. Multiple splits with tuning
 
 ## Let's start
 
  1. Clone the repo: https://github.com/eurotox-2023-aitox-cec/course-materials
  
  ```
  ## run in Terminal
  git clone
  ```
